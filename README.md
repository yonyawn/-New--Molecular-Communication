This is another simple molecular communication simulator created in Java for a mentorship project,
with relevance to the changes in concentration of cells in the area.

An environment is created in the main class with set height and width. 

Cells and molecules can be created in the environment. Currently, molecules can move around 
the environment in each simulation cycle randomly and the output shows the molecule's location.

Differential equations are used to calculate the changes in molecule concentrations intracellularly and extracellularly, 
based on three variables:
 1)  the exchange of input molecules from the extracellular to the intracellular environment,
 2)  the signal processing of output molecules through regulated gene expressions, and
 3)  the release of the output molecules from the intracellular to the extracellular environment.
